title: Puzzle: N Chairs Skip Every Other
layout: post
---

My friend [Carlos](http://carlosgalban.com) is currently interviewing at various companies 

Original Puzzle: You are in a room with N chairs. The chairs are numbered sequentially from 1 to N.

At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be asked to leave. The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be asked to leave. This pattern of skipping one person and asking the next to leave will keep going until there is one person left.

The Assignment
==============

Write an iOS Objective-C app to determine which chair number the last person is sitting in, given N as input provided by the user. The user should be able to:

  1. Specify N
  2. Calculate the last person's chair number.
  3. Specify a new N, and obtain a new answer, and so on.

Please observe the following when designing and implementing the app:

  1. The interface should be simple, clean, and obvious.
  2. The implementation should adhere to and exhibit your understanding of standard iOS design patterns.
  3. You're free to be as creative as you like, within the guidelines listed above.

Hint: For N, be sure to try large numbers such as the number of seats in Michigan Stadium (109,901).

Please provide your solution as an Xcode project which compiles and links without warnings, and runs on an iOS simulator.

In addition to the zip file of your solution please state in your email the correct answer when the input is 100 chairs.
