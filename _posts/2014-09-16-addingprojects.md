Finally got around to actually adding one of my projects to the site. It was the simpliest one to write up and it I learned a lot about Markdown while writing it. Using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables) tables w/ Markdown isn't complicated but something I had to look up. Also I got the code highlighting working correctly using [Pygments](http://pygments.org/languages/). 

So heres the [BCD Multiplier](/projects/bcd-multiplier-verilog) I wrote in verilog in the summer of 2014.
