title: Website Update

I finally decided to redo my website and move away from Wordpress. I have nothing against it - I just wanted a change and wanted to try something new. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) seemed interesting and its really just an excuse to finally learn Markdown and play around with Ruby. 

I'm not sure what the look of the site will have. Knowing me its not going to change much from how it is now. I think I'll just stick with Bootstrap for now and lets see how often I update the site. 

I did add [Disqus](https://disqus.com) for the comments - it seems a lot of blogs now-a-days are using it. 

I will eventually get around to writing posts about the projects I've been working on - I mean I should so other people know what I'm working on other than my Dropbox.
