## Quotes I Like

*Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.* 
- Walt Whitman


*If you don't like change, you're going to like irrelevance even less.* 
- General Eric Shinseki, Chief of Staff, U.S. Army

*A difference that makes no difference is no difference*

*The man who said "I'd rather be lucky than good" saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control.*

*Alice asked the Chesire Cat, who was sitting in a tree, "What road do I take?"
The cat asked, "Where do you want to go?"

Specialization is for insects."*

Average minds discuss events;
Small minds discuss people.*

*Inquiry is fatal to certainty*

*Relationships don't work they way they do on television and in the movies. Will they? Won't they? And then they finally do, and they're happy forever. Gimme a break. Nine out of ten of them end because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half of the ones who get married get divorced anyway, and I'm telling you right now, through all this stuff I have not become a cynic. I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate covered candies and, y'know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, because I do believe in it. Bottom line: it's couples who are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but the big difference is they don't let it take them down. One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time. If it's right, and they're real lucky, one of them will say something.*
