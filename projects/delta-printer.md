# Delta Printer

Based on the [design](http://www.openbuilds.com/builds/delta-six.476/) from open builds. 

Cut the V-Slot aluminum to 360mm for the edges of the base and kept the stock 1000mm for the towers. 

Used Jerry's design for the vertex and seems to work pretty well but kind of tight in PLA and required a little bit of sanding to get them to fit. PETG might have worked better since it has less shrinkage. All of Jerry's [models](http://www.openbuilds.com/threads/delta-six.339/page-21)

When making the carriages for the towers I used the universal plate as [reference](http://makerstore.cc/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/V-Slot-Gantry-Plate-9.jpg). Normal hole: 5mm dia, escentric spacer hole: 7.2mm dia. Space between centers for 2040 longwise: 59.70mm. I decided to make the plate 60x80x3mm.
